    <p class="contentHeader">Hello!</p>
    <p class="contentFill">My name is Francisco Robles and I am a graduate from Arizona State University.
        My passion for computer science started back in junior year of high school when I had the opportunity
        to take my first computer science class as part of a new program. This class allowed me to get fundamental
        experience in programming using Java, Javafx, HTML, and CSS. This is essentially what laid the foundation
        for my continued pursuit into a computer science career.
    </p>
    <p class="contentFill">I started my education at Arizona State University in Fall of 2019. This is where I was
        able to grasp key concepts like object oriented programming, service oriented architecture, computer architecture,
        and data structures and algorithms. Throughout my four year degree I was able to apply these concepts on many
        challenging group projects like an autonomous lego car, multiple different applications, and embedded work involving
        branch predictors and cache replacement policies. With this academic experience, I was able to start my career at the 
        Salt River Project (SRP) as a Systems Integration Analyst where I was able to get first hand experience with the integration
        world which involved working with widely used APIs such as ServiceNow and OpenText. Additionally, I gained experience developing integrations
        from scratch that would automate business processes and ensure delivery of critical business information. With this
        experience, I have grown my knowledge base and have been exposed to the professional practice of computer science.
    </p>
    <p class="contentFill">Ultimately, I look forward to continuing to grow my career and building my skills in any way that I can.
        I know I still have a lot to learn when it comes to the professional field of computer science and I think this is truly exciting.
    </p>

<div class = "projects" id="content2" style="width: 60%;">
    <p class="contentHeader">Autonomous Lego Car</p>
    <p class="contentFill">Built a car out of electronic lego-like pieces in a group of four and programmed the logic behind the
        autonomous maneuvering in MATLAB.
        Also implemented the car recognizing certain colors for stops while also being able to pick up a cardboard passenger in a maze.
    </p>
    <p class="contentHeader">Clinic Application</p>
    <p class="contentFill">In JavaFX with a group of four, we made a GUI to be used in a clinic by nurses and doctors who have the needed
        credentials to login. We were able to add in functionality for the doctors or nurses to be able to add or remove patients while
        also being able to bring up a patient's prior visits and general health information.
    </p>
    <p class="contentHeader">PostgreSQL Data Visualization Application</p>
    <p class="contentFill">Using Python and a PostgreSQL server for the database, in a group of four, made a GUI to be used to visualize COVID-19 
        data with different graphs.Additionally, we made PostgreSQL calls to the server and used these calls with the Tkinter, Psycopg2, Pandas, 
        and Matplotlib libraries in Python to create the GUI and demonstrate correct data.</p>
    <p class="contentHeader">GSelect Branch Predictor</p>
    <p class="contentFill">In a group of two, we implemented a GSelect branch predictor in gem5 with C by comparing the already implemented 2-bit local and the bi-mode 
        branch predictors. We analyzed the strengths of the other two branch predictors and created a new branch predictor using these strengths to improve performance
         of branch prediction.</p>
    <p class="contentHeader">Cache Replacement Policy</p>
    <p class="contentFill">Programmed a least-recently-used and insertion and promotion vector cache replacement policy in a group of two.
        Essentially the new cache replacement policy took two different cache replacement policies and combined them into one. The combined
        cache replacement policy reduces the miss rate for cache and essentially leads to more efficient use of cache.
    </p>
    <p class="contentHeader">Web Application</p>
    <p class="contentFill">Created web services in C# using Visual Studio, these services would convert fahrenheit to celsius and returned current climate 
        conditions in associated latitude and longitude values given by the user. The application was then linked to the created services and called the services in order 
        to convert between units and display weather conditions in a simple GUI.</p>
    <p class="contentHeader">Catalytic Converter Alarm System</p>
    <p class="contentFill">In a group of four, we created a catalytic converter alarm system that would arm itself based on vibrations gathered from the mounting location.
        We also implemented real time notifications along with an audible alarm connected to a Raspberry Pi 3 and an accelerometer.
        The group did extensive market research by interviewing potential customers and local law enforcement to try and provide the best solution to deter these type of thefts.</p>
